            | Start By Asking Questions
        p After analyzing the design challenge prompt, asking questions helps me determine further research direction and discover what is the real problem. Asking question also help me aware of my own assumptions. I asked questions like:
        ul
            li What is the process of a deal?
            li What is sales pipeline and how does it help sales person?
            li What information involved when working on a deal?
            li How can Base fit into sales person’s process?
            li What are the scenarios and contexts of using mobile CRM application?
            li When and why do sales people need certain kind of information?

                p In order to design the deal profile page, it's important to understand the big picture first such as how the CRM works and what are current products? I looked through the following materials to understand how CRM works:
                ul
                    li BASE website: general information, support page and eBook
                    li BASE mobile APP

        p In order to understand what are the needs of sales people? How do they work currently, I conducted user interviews to better understand users' motivation and work flow:

        h3.item-title Provide more information at a glance
        p Before a meeting or a call, sales person always need to do research on their client about their background information, the company’s updates as well as their problems, so it is important for them to recap all information right before the meeting or call.
        h3.item-title Quick interaction on mobile
        p Sales have to work with a lot of deals at the same time so efficient is pretty important for them especially when they are using a mobile device, which means they are probably heading to a meeting. So providing efficient and quick interaction is important.

                p According to the user research and my understanding of how CRM works, I regroup the information of current deal profile based on the frequency users will view or add data. One participant mentioned that he will use activities and collaborator when there are new team members involved in the deal, so I put this information into the second tab.

                h3.item-title Interface With Scalability
                p In order to solve the scalability issue as well as provide the possibility to customize deal profile, I sketch out several concepts. Base on sales person’s needs of viewing more information at one time and quick interaction, I organized these concepts and select one to develop further.

                h3.item-title Quick Ways to Add Objects
                p I explored several ways to quickly add objects within the main page. How I decide on using which concept depends if the interaction is clear or intuitive to users and how the concept can work well with scalability.

            p.sub ITERATIVE PROCESS
            | Iterate on "Stage Change" Interaction
        p The concept of present different stage first comes from the “steps” and “progress” design pattern. But during wireframing, I found this concept doesn’t provide enough interaction affordance for users. So then I turn into using “slider” and start to iterate on it to make it not only clear to interact with but also can present the stage information

In the "Contact" card, the name showed is this deals’ primary contact.

When user wants to change the stage, they can go back simply by scrolling back.
