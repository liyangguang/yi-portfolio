        p The first brainstorming session of my process is always asking a lot of questions. Asking questions and analyze them can help me better understand the context and figure out next steps. On the other hand, asking a lot "why" questions helps me to better understand users needs and reframe research questions.

                p Affinity diagram of the interview notes helps me to better understand what is the main pain point and what are the different needs of different users.

                p In the photos tab, users can view all the photos and albums. In the settings page, users can set up whether they want to use cellular data to back up photos. Considering some photos are taken by DSLR and file size is large, users can set the image quality to view on mobile, which can influence the usage of cellular data and loading speed. Users can also set their own gesture preferences.
