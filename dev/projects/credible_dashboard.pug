        h2 which offer should I choose?
        p Credible is a marketplace for student loan refinancing. It helps borrowers get personalized rates from multiple lenders. It's great that users can receive multiple offers by providing data once. But the terms and benefits of each offer are very different. How to design the offer dashboard to help users find the best offer?

    section
        p.section-type.font-gilroy user research
        h2 how do people make choices?
        p In order to better meet users' needs, it's important to understand how do people make their choice among several options. I conducted user interviews to gather insights about the process of choosing a product and factors influence decision making.

            p.quote-title "The refinancing offer should be better than my current loan"
            p.bold.dark Need current loan information for reference
            p For student loan refinancing users, they have very a clear goal that the refinancing offer should offer more benefit than their current loan. So users need their current loan information for reference.  
        .quote-wrap
            p.quote-title "I can only pay up to $600 a month"
            p.bold.dark Filter the options with fixed criteria in mind
            p Before choosing the product, people usually have fixed criteria in mind. For example, their income situation will determine the maximize monthly payment. Some users are clear that they don't want to choose variable rate because they don't want to take the risk of APR getting higher.
        .quote-wrap
            p.quote-title "I can't tell what I want right now but I know what I don't"
            p.bold.dark Eliminate options that users are not interested in
            p For users who are shopping around, they really want to make sure they choose the best option. But it's quite difficult to find the best at once. Users prefer to eliminate options that they are not interested in and finally get to their favorite one.

        h3 Where does current loan information live?
        p The information architecture of the dashboard really affects how users process the information. So, where should current loan information live? I thought about the focus on the page structure first. I took these questions into consideration to make sure users can understand and navigate through dashboard easily.

                p The sliders provide a clear visual cue of what it is and how to use it. However, adjusting the sliders to a specific number can be a difficult task. So I decide to keep the slider pattern but also give users the ability to type in they desired number directly.

            li The participant liked that he can archive offers he doesn't like, but he felt the "not interested" button call too much attention.

        p First, I changed the label "Apply discounts" to "APR discounts", so that users can understand what this filter is related to. Then I started to really think about users mental model - users would like to know possible discounts, then filter out if they don't meet requirements. So I decide to make the default to show both discounts, and users can un-check if they don't meet requirements.
